# 🎓 Student Result Prediction using Logistic Regression

## 📝 Overview:
A simple and beginner-friendly ML project that predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on their marks using Logistic Regression. Built using Python, this project helps you understand the basics of classification algorithms in machine learning.

## 🚀 Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression

## 📊 Dataset:
Custom sample data with marks in three subjects:
- Maths
- Science
- English

Labels:
- 1 = Pass
- 0 = Fail

## 💡 What You'll Learn:
- How to prepare a dataset
- Splitting training and testing sets
- Training a classification model
- Making predictions
- Evaluating accuracy

## 📁 Files:
- `Student_Result_Prediction.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with complete code and results
- `README.md` — This documentation

## 🔚 Result:
After training, the model can predict whether a new student will pass or fail based on their subject scores.
